1. Global execution context (inside "this")
2. Function/Functional execution context
3. Eval Execution context

=> Memory creation phase then Execution phase 

Step 1. (as mentioned in the first line)
Step 2. Memory phase => All the variables are put together and kept AND asssigned as UNDEFINED
        Declared function gets a definition

New Executional Context (i.e. new environment variable + execution thread are created) is created when arguments are passed into the function call.
